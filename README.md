I'm a full stack engineer who is passionate about web development, web security, and technology in general. I enjoy working with ReactJS, and using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Node). I perfer writing my own CSS, and utilized in it React using StyledComponents.

Here's some of my projects I've worked on:

- <a href="https://github.com/Red4lpha/Message-Board">Interactive comment section</a>:  -  I've designed this to be part of a larger project I am working on. It's a full stack CRUD app that allows users to create, edit, delete, reply and vote on comment messages - as well as form validation and user auth. React, Typescript, Express, MongoDB, and a small touch of Material UI
- <a href="https://github.com/Red4lpha/WeatherApp">Minimalist Weather App</a>:  -  Clean and minimalist weather app. Used my own vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS. 
- <a href="https://github.com/Red4lpha/Shopping-Cart-Project">Retro sneakers shop</a>:  -  My take at creating a responsive store front specializing in retro sneakers. Utilized React and Tailwind CSS.
